# Temperature-Converter

![Python](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Language%20Used&message=Python&color=blue&logo=python&logoColor=white)<br>
A repository for converting temperature entered by a user from a given scale to other units<br>
The underlying theory is the formula for conversion of temperatures from one unit to another.

### Usage
The program prompts the user to `Choose a scale for entering the temperature`. Upon entering the choice, the program then asks to `Enter temperature` and finally outputs a `pandas.DataFrame` which has:
- `Celsius`:  The temperature in Celsius scale (if value entered in Celsius, then same as input)
- `Fahrenheit`: The temperature in Fahrenheit scale (if value entered in Fahrenheit, then same as input)
- `Kelvin`: The temperature in Kelvin scale (if value entered in Kelvin, then same as input)
